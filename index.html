    <h3> Dedication. Effort. Hard work. These are some of the tools a person needs to achieve his or her goal. People wonder what is the secret to a certain person’s success. Some say they are born with it, others say people helped them. The true answer is practice. There are three reasons why practice will guide a person to fulfill his or her goals; one is hard work, another is motivation, and having learning goals.</h3>

        <h2>Learn LCS.
        </h2>
        <p>The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the longest common substring problem: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility, and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics.</p>
